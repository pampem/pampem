### Hello World! 👋
I'm Masashi, a drone researcher currently studying at the AIST & Tsukuba University. My journey in the realm of technology doesn't stop there; I'm also delving into the fields of computer science and engineering. 🚁💻

Presently, I'm collaborating with the cool minds at AIST on a project to automate forklifts, making warehouses smarter and safer. 🤖🏭
